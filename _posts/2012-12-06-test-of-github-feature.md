title: Testing the new GitHub Feature

# GitHub Feature

GitHub has a new feature to add files directly on their website. I just wanted here to test it. You have to click on the "new file" link in any directory of any of your repositories. If you don't own the repository, GitHub will fork the repository automatically to you and helps you to create a pull-request. 

# Verdict

I wrote this post with this new feature. It's really cool if you manage a blog in GitHub (or another page) with GitHub Pages. But if there would be a GitHub App for the IPad, I wouldnt mind this feature.
