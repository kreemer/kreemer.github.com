# Maya Animation

I've just have finished my first animation created with Autodesk Maya. It was for a school project, so it isn't spectacular.

However, i'm proud of the result. Many things I could have improved like the animation or the quality of the movie, but it was enough for the first try... I think...

If you are interested in the movie: Link is [here](http://youtu.be/U5neKzdJRms "Title").
