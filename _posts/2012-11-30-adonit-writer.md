# Adonit Writer

Just wanted to write something about my new Adonit Writer for my IPad (3th generation). It is actually a case with a keyboard for the IPad. It's really cool, pairing with bluetooth works flawlessly. My biggest concern before i bought the Adonit Writer was that I couldn't use my pen for the IPad anymore. But you can easily detach the keyboard and just use the case. So I can write with the keyboard or the pen. 

BTW: this post i wrote with the Adonit Writer and my IPad (the App who does the GitHub integration is called Worqshop, but I don't suggest that app until it supports to delete files).
